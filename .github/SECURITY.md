## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please email us instead of using the issue tracker. This helps us fix the issue without publicly disclosing it.

### Steps to Report:

1. Email the security details to the maintainer
2. Include proof-of-concept if possible
3. Allow time for a fix before public disclosure
